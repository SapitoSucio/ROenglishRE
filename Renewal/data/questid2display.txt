The old scholar Defaria requested for some materials to unseal the scroll. 30 of each Holy Water, Rune of Darkness and Bloody Rune.#

7427#At times like this, face it straight on!#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#

7447#Dilemma surrounding the Orb#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#

8017#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zelmeto has asked you to help him inspect the machines in the factory one at a time to know which one needs to be fixed. Find the 2nd control panel and report back to Zelmeto.#
#

8018#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You found the 2nd control panel and it is completely broken. Report this back to Zelmeto.#
#

8019#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zelmeto asked you to inspect the automatic pressure governors and to report any problems no matter how small they may seem.#
#

8020#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You found the automatic pressure governors and after checking more carefully, you find that it's making strange grinding noises and a few of the surface screws are loose. Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8021#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Now Zelmeto asked you to inspect another control panel. It's similar to the first one but bigger. It's located in the middle of the factory. Find it and report back to Zelmeto.#
#

8022#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The main control panel doesn't look like it has any problems. But after tapping on its surface, you hear a disheartening hollow sound. It looks like it's missing some parts... Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8023#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zelmeto asked you to inspect a mechanical hand that transports small objects. Find it and report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8024#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The conveyor's movements look jittery and clumsy. The mechanical arm also doesn't look powerful enough to bear the loads that it's carrying... Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8025#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Now you must inspect a pipe located near the large cauldrons of molten metal and report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8026#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The pipe you found is bloated and worn out from long durations of being overloaded with pressure. It's a wonder it hasn't exploded yet. Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8027#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The final thing Zelmeto has asked you to inspect is a bigger and more powerful conveyor. Find it and report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8028#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
This last conveyor seems to have similar problems to its smaller version. Its movements are awkward, erratic and weak, and almost all of its screws are rusted. Report your findings to Zelmeto.#
#

8029#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zelmeto tells you that he needs to request an increase in the Factory Repair budget from the superintendant to make sure they have enough materials for the repairs. Find the superintendant.#
#

8030#Factory Inspection#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
The superintendant refused to approve the increase in the Factory Repair budget. You'd better report the bad news to Zelmeto.#

El Schatt says that there was a time when he would have protected the tree with his life but that it should be buried in the past. You should find someone that might know about his past.#

#

8196#The Tripartite Union's Feud#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Those researchers complain a lot these days. They're terribly stressed out and I think somebody should really listen to their problems. Especially those dealing with document files argue with each other many times. You might wanna start by talking to them.#
#

8197#Document Delivery#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Ok, now, please deliver the file to Hue and Hansenne. Hue's in charge of Schwartzvalt documents and Hansenne's in charge of Arunafeltz'. You should go see Hue at Schwartzvalt's office, otherwise, he'd be whining about it.#

I've requested something to Arunafeltz office but haven't got anything yet. Could you get it from Hansenne? I need that for the meeting but he never sends it to me. He must've forgotten about it, again!#
#

8201#Missing Document#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I lost it. I think I might have dropped it into the river or something when I played treasure-hunting on a bridge! But then,those pussy cats on the South-West can teach us fishing, you know. Maybe we can catch that document fishing on the river!#
Go back to Hansenne with the document you caught#

8202#Document Restoration#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Schwartzwalt people have some talent in restoring things like this... Why don't you ask Hue to restore this? He'd scream so hard and the windows might break.#
#

8203#Document Restoration#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
It's completely soaked.. I should dry this thing first and iron these crumples. Then, I should restore the texts. I need some materials. You gotta help me on this. I need ^0000ff1 Folding Fan of Cat Ghost, 1 Old Frying Pan, 1 Flame Stone, 1 Squid Ink^000000.#

#

8208#Hansenne's Favor#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
He'll be ok soon. He'll get to think that it wasn't actually a big deal. But the thing is that... the relationship between Ryosen and Hue isn't looking good at all. Why don't you help them get along with each other?#
#

Here, this is the Rune-Midgard's report I took with me when everything went messy in the meeting room.. Could you please give this to Ryosen?#

Ah, I see that you have a fairly good understanding of the Provoke skill. Next time we speak, I will tell you what I know about the ^5D478BEndure^000000 skill. When you're ready to learn, come back to me.#
Listen to Shurank's Lecture#

8221#Shurank's Lecture#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Activating Endure enables you to shrug off attacks. You'll receive damage, but enemy attacks will not impede you as much. This means you can counter enemy attacks or escape if you need to. Alright. Now I want you to train in the use of the Endure skill. You can become a great Swordman.#
Master the skill, Endure, and return to Shurank#

8222#Shurank's order#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#

Why do you want to learn about it? Even if I wanted to teach, I'm too old to remember everything. Go find my last disciple, ^0000FF'Song Zhi Du'^000000, as he may tell you something useful.#
Find Song Zhi Du working at the doctor's office and ask about the use of poison#

11071#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Go do whatever you were going to do. I'm just disappointed...#
Song Zhi Du seems to be mad now. Can make him feel better by bringing something to him#

11072#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
If you really feel sorry for me, then you must help me carry out my revenge! Go and get me, ^0000FF4 Bee Sting, 10 Venom Canine, 10 Empty Potion, 30 Green Potion^000000.#
Return to Song Zhi Du with materials he asked for#

11073#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
All that's left is to create this poison, and then to get the lord of Louyang to drink it...#
Talk with him again and listen to the story, then do the favor of Song Zhi Du#

11074#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Now that the fee is paid, please bring this to Song Zhi Du.#
You've obtained the material. Go back to Song Zhi Du#

11075#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#

More materials are needed#

11076#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Please sneak into the Castle of the Dragon. I want you to put this poison some place where Lord Bai Long might stay. Anyway, I'm sure my master will be happy to know that I finally created the ^0000FFpoison he wished to create^000000!#
What should I do?#

11077#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You found a drink bottle that's possibly owned by Bai Long, lord of Louyang. You put the deadly poison into the bottle.#
You've done what Song Zhi Du asked for. Let's go back#

11078#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You tell Nagash Arses how Song Zhi Du created this Deadly Poison Bottle and his plan to get his revenge on the lord of Louyang.#
Looks like he needs some time alone#

11079#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I beg of you. Please do not let him bring any harm to the lord. I am pretty sure he's been asking you, as well as others, for aid... Please interrupt him from carrying out his plan.#
Get rid of the drink bottle of Bai Long#

11080#Poison King#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You take the drink bottle and replace it with a bottle filled with Sticky Mucus. Hopefully Bai Long won't notice!#
Replacement Successful! Go back to Nagash Arses#

This is a journal that I have been writing for 15 years about my feelings of guilt, and what really happened in the past. I hope you can deliver this to the lord for me.#

The village girl doesn't seem to know much. Return to Las#

11289#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Head office wouldn't send me to a place like this if they weren't sure of themselves. Will you try to talk with another villager?#
Talk with the village man, south of the hospital#

11290#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I'll have to report this information quickly. Sorry but will you go to the inn in the middle of the village with the nurse?#
Return to Las for now#

11291#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
My feet hurt and I cannot move anymore. Can you go to the inn alone?#
Meet the doctor at the inn located at the center of the village#

11292#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I can't go to the hospital right now because I have patients to look after. Can you go back with the key and tell her "Do as you wish".#
Return to Las#

11293#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Put in the key in the keyhole of the Hospital Door. But the door doesn't seem to be locked.#

11296#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Pulled out the deeply stuck stick. The hospital's melancholy atmosphere seems to double.#

11297#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Will you visit my grandma, please? I'll go around to check the hospital here.#
Visit her grandmother at the west of the village a bit north from the hospital#

Continue to talk with the grandmother#

11299#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#

It's nearby#

11303#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
How did the nurse get through with the entrance bolted up?#
Return to Las#

11304#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Wouldn't the grandmother who pasted the agimat outside of the hospital know about this agimat?#
Talk with the grandmother#

11305#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Asked Shaman at the north of the village to create this.#
Visit Shaman at the north of the village#

11306#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I feel something very ominous from you.#
Received an agimat. Return to Las#

11307#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Let's paste that agimat onto the agimat we saw at the 2F entrance. It might help block the ominous energy from that one.#
Past the agimat onto the 2F entrance agimat#

11308#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
As soon as you paste the agimat on top of the other one, the ominous energy feels faded away just like Las said.#
Feel like Las was playing you. Talk with the nurse in front of the hospital#

11309#Nurse at Port Malaya#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You've not only interrupted my job but you also brought her to the room making you responsible. Don't think of running away.#

Ask Librarian Jekan if he has found the 1st squad's final mission's paper work. He has bad eyesight and is in need of a Magnifier and a Lantern.#
#

60724#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Librarian Jekan looks to be busy, perhaps I should just "read some documents" for awhile and then check on the shelves for until he figures out where I should check on the shelves for "The 3rd Platoon Records".#
#

60725#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Jekan will need a few items to make a copy of the records. 2 Slick Paper and 1 Oil Paper from Amatsu, 3 Feather of Birds from Morocc, and 20 Blue Gems from Geffen.#
Bring these items to Jekan to make him finish the copy faster#

60726#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Your copy of the records has a weird search magic on it. To find specific info, you need to first check for broad topic then get more specific: crusader 3rd_company 3rd_platoon 1st_squad.#
Look up the individual members names to find out where they are nowadays#

60727#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Find Zan Huadoku inside the Geffen Blacksmith guild. Observe politeness when asking him how he is doing before jumping in to ask about their top secret final mission. Yeah, that's the ticket!#
#

60728#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Zan Huadoku has told you all that you think is possible. You should head to Morocc to find "Cuaque Donon" who was last seen at the Inn. You have a feeling that you may need to be stubborn in Morocc.#
#

60729#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Cuaque Donon is in a Rogue Guild hideout probably at "Fortress Saint Darmain (South)" (use map ctrl + ~) The password to enter should be "Aragham never hoarded upgrade items".#
Cuaque is suffering from extreme PTSD and "freaks out" so pretending he is a young child would help, maybe even a dolly hahaha#

60730#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Cuaque said the squad found the "Megingjard" and an argument broke out... You need to know more about that argument, perhaps Jack.O in Alberta on the docks can help.#
He is still an active crusader, so I think talking to him will be much more straight forward#

60731#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Jack.O found some relief from "Green Herb". Perhaps I should pass that advice onto the other Crusaders I meet. Emma Searth is in Aldebaran, a quick boat to Izlude and a Kafra warp to Aldebaran will have me there in a jiffy!#
Maybe I should also contemplate a memory aid for these crusaders, something to help them remember their place like a "Bookclip" from a "Rideword"#

60732#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
I think I need to hurry to see "The Nineball" he works as a bouncer in the Jawaii inn. I heard there is an ex-barkeep of Jawaii working in the Central Prontera Pub maybe he knows a way to get to Jawaii without tying the knot!#
Someone named Nineball and who is a bouncer probably is pretty closed mouth kinda guy, I should keep talking until he at least reacts to my questions..#

Exit Jawaii with a Butterflywing or drink yourself back to Rune-Midgarts. Get to Comodo to see "Royal Myst" at the south casino. Morocc to Comodo is usually the easiest way to warp to Comodo.#
A "couple" of shots of "Alcohol" can loosen Royal Myst's tongue..#

60734#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You've spoken to all the crusaders that are still alive, apparently something happened, blame was passed and Crusader Egnigem died in the process. You should return to Prontera Castle and inform him of your findings.#
A kafra hop from Comodo to Morocc to Prontera is quick unless you're saved in Prontera#

60735#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
You should talk with the last member of the 1st squad, the late Egnigem. A Kafra hop from Prontera to Morocc to Comodo then to Umbala and then a journey north to the Tree of Life to Nifflheim can get you to him.#
Listen to Egnigem and see what you can do to fix this#

60736#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
By Odin's mercy this is terrible, you never believed that a holy Crusader would do such an evil act to claim the power of Megingjard. Be brave and return to the Crusader Headquarters and tell Max Von Shedough what you know.#
#

60737#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Max Von Shedough has accepted my report, and is deeply troubled by its contents, but part of me truly believes that despite good intentions the political reality may intervene to keep justice from being had.#
I must tell Egnigem at least of the outcome, he deserves at least to know what he died for.#

60738#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Egnigem has blessed you with all his remaining strength. You have a feeling that there is one special someone that he would want to know his fate, You must tell Emma Searth about his fate.#
#

60739#Seal of Megingjard#SG_FEEL#QUE_NOIMAGE#
Emma can't Remember, but she can feel the loss. Your faith in Justice is weak now... You must tell Max Von Shedough he is the Judge and he should share this burden of guilt.#
